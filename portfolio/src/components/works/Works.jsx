          Welcome! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to view my
          progress so far. My name is Demetre Growette, I am a young Minnesota
          adult living the California life. I decided that I needed a change of
          direction and finally pursing something that I believe is right for
          me. In order to better myself for myself, I chose to challenge myself
          by entering the world of coding and push myself to become what
          everyone else told me I wouldn't.
          I've recently finished my stint at U.C. Davis and persuing a career as
          a full stack web developer. Throughout my time with U.C Davis, I've
          gained experience on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5,
          CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node Js, MySQL,
          MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js, & ReactJS. Prior to to my bootcamp
          experience I had only had beginner knowledge of Python, but with my new
          found love for web development. I look forward to learning and
          creating more for the world.

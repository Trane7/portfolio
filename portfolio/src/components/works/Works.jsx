          Welcome! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to view my
          progress so far. My name is Demetre Growette, I am a very outgoing
          individual who is easy to work with and tends to make work life more
          exciting. Last year I decided that I needed a change of direction and
          am finally pursing something that I believe is right path for me. In
          order to better myself, I chose to enter the world of coding and push
          to become what everyone else told me I couldn't. A little over a year
          ago I finished my bootcamp at U.C. Davis and persuing a career as a
          Front-End Web Developer. Throughout my time with U.C. Davis, I've
          gained experience on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5,
          CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, AWS, GraphQL, &
          React.js. I am currently working as a part-time Teaching Assistant at
          2U Trinity Learning Center Coding Bootcamps and found a new love for
          web development and I look forward to learning and creating more
          intuitive projects to expan my knowledge in coding!
